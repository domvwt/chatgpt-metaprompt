# Metaprompt

The metaprompt framework was originally developed by Anthropic's team to help users create clear, structured instructions for their AI assistant, Claude.
This framework supports accurate and consistent task performance by providing practical principles and examples for prompt engineering.
You can find more information and examples in Anthropic's documentation here:
